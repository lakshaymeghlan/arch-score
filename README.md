# "arch-score"

> A language-agnostic CLI that scores how well **any** project follows modern system-design standards, recommends the best folder structure, and emits guidance files that make AI coding assistants follow good system design.

`arch-score` is a **heuristic advisor**, not a judge. It gives you a score (0–100), explains *why* points were lost with file-level references, and hands you prioritized, concrete fixes. It works on frontend or backend code in **any language**, runs **fully offline**, and has **zero paid dependencies**.

## Install

```bash
# Run without installing
npx arch-score .

# Or install globally
npm install -g arch-score
archscore .
```

Requires Node.js ≥ 18.

---

## Quick start

```bash
archscore .                       # pretty terminal report
archscore ./service --ci          # exit non-zero if below threshold (CI gate)
archscore . --json > report.json  # machine-readable
archscore . --html                # writes archscore-report.html
archscore . --emit-md             # writes SYSTEM_DESIGN.md playbook
archscore . --emit-skill --format claude   # writes CLAUDE.md for AI assistants
```

## How it works: tiered analysis

`arch-score` auto-detects languages, frameworks, and project type from manifests
(`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `pom.xml`, `Cargo.toml`, `composer.json`, `Gemfile`, …) and file extensions, then runs two tiers:

- **Universal tier** — works for **every** language. Folder/architecture pattern detection, config-as-env vs hardcoded, test presence & ratio, docs, CI/CD, containerization, observability config, dependency-manifest health, secret-leakage heuristics, and file/module size outliers.
- **Deep tier** — optional per-language plugins that build a real import/dependency graph for **circular-dependency**, **fan-in/fan-out**, and **graph-depth** analysis. Ships with adapters for **JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, and Go**. For unsupported languages it **degrades gracefully** to universal-tier scoring and tells you which tier ran.

The report header always states the tier used, and any category that can't be
fairly assessed is **re-weighted out** (its weight is redistributed) rather than
scored zero — so an unsupported language is never silently penalized.

---

## The rubric

Each category is scored 0–100 against a transparent rubric (start at 100, lose
points per finding), then combined into a weighted overall score. The default
profile is **structure-first**:

| Category | Weight | Tier | What it rewards |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| **Architecture & Layering** | 20 | Universal | A recognizable pattern, thin entry points, no god-folders |
| **Folder Structure** | 16 | Universal | Layout matches a convention for the detected project type; sane depth |
| **Modularity & Coupling** | 12 | Deep* | No circular deps, no fan-out/fan-in outliers, shallow graph |
| **Testing Architecture** | 12 | Universal | Test presence, healthy test-to-source ratio, integration layer, CI |
| **Config & 12-Factor** | 10 | Universal | Env-based config, `.env.example`, no committed `.env`, no hardcoded endpoints |
| **Error Handling & Resilience** | 8 | Universal | No swallowed errors, a central handler, timeouts/retries for services |
| **Security Hygiene** | 8 | Universal | No leaked secrets, `.gitignore` covers env, lockfile committed |
| **Observability** | 7 | Universal | Structured logging, metrics/tracing deps, health endpoints |
| **Documentation** | 7 | Universal | A substantial README, architecture docs, contributing guide |

\* Modularity uses the Deep tier when an adapter supports the language; otherwise
it falls back to a coarse module-size cohesion proxy and says so.

### Rubric details

<details>
<summary><b>Architecture &amp; Layering (20)</b></summary>

- −30 — no recognizable pattern (layered / hexagonal / feature / MVC) or code is flat

<details>
<summary><b>Error Handling &amp; Resilience (8)</b></summary>

- −12 — no metrics/tracing instrumentation
- −10 — no health/readiness endpoint
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Security Hygiene (8)</b></summary>

- −up to 45 — likely hardcoded secrets/credentials

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Documentation (7)</b></summary>

- −40 — no README

Grades: **A** ≥ 90, **B** ≥ 80, **C** ≥ 70, **D** ≥ 60, **E** ≥ 50, else **F**.

## Folder-structure advisor

`arch-score` classifies your **current** structure (`layered`, `hexagonal/clean`,
`feature/domain`, `mvc`, or `flat`) and recommends the **best** structure for the
detected project type, with a concrete proposed tree and rationale:

| Project type | Recommended | Shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Backend** API/service | Hexagonal / Clean | `domain/ application/ infrastructure/ interfaces/http/ config/` |
| **Frontend** SPA | Feature-based | `app/ features/<feature>/{components,hooks,api,state}/ shared/` |
| **CLI** | Layered | thin `bin/` → `commands/` → pure `core/` → `adapters/` |
| **Library** | Public surface | `src/index` + hidden `internal/` |
| **Mobile** | Feature-modular | `features/ navigation/ design-system/` |
| **Monorepo** | Workspaces | `apps/` + `packages/`, each following its own type |

Run with `--emit-md` to get the full proposed tree and gap diff.

## Guidance file generation

This is the differentiator: encode your project's conventions + the recommended
architecture as **actionable rules for AI coding assistants**.

```bash
archscore . --emit-md                      # SYSTEM_DESIGN.md — human playbook
archscore . --emit-skill --format agents   # AGENTS.md
archscore . --emit-skill --format claude   # CLAUDE.md
archscore . --emit-skill --format cursor   # .cursorrules
archscore . --emit-skill --format copilot  # .github/copilot-instructions.md
```

See [`examples/`](./examples) for real generated output.

---

## Output modes & CI

```bash
archscore . --ci --threshold 80   # exit code 1 if overall < 80
archscore . --json                # full JSON report (graph summarized)
archscore . --html=report.html    # self-contained HTML report
```

`--ci` makes it a quality gate you can drop into any pipeline.

---

## Optional AI deep-review (`--deep-ai`)

The core tool is 100% offline and uses **no AI**. The optional `--deep-ai` flag
adds a qualitative architecture review on top — and it stays **free**:

- **Local & free:** install [Ollama](https://ollama.com), `ollama pull llama3.1`, then `archscore . --deep-ai`. Runs fully offline at zero cost.
- **Your own API key:** `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...` and `arch-score` will use Anthropic instead. Your key is used directly and **never bundled** with the package.

If neither is available, `--deep-ai` prints a friendly note and the rest of the
report is unaffected. Only metrics and findings are sent — **never your source code**.

```bash
ARCHSCORE_AI_PROVIDER=ollama  ARCHSCORE_AI_MODEL=llama3.1  archscore . --deep-ai
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...       ARCHSCORE_AI_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-6  archscore . --deep-ai
```

---

## Configuration

Drop an `archscore.config.js` (or `.mjs` / `.json`) in your project root. See
[`archscore.config.example.js`](./archscore.config.example.js):

```js
export default {
  weights: { architecture: 25, testing: 15 }, // re-normalized automatically
  ignore: ["generated", "third_party"],
  threshold: 75,
  // projectType: "backend",  // force instead of auto-detecting
};
```

---

## Programmatic API

```ts
import { analyzeProject, renderTerminal, generateSkill } from "arch-score";

const report = analyzeProject("./my-project");
console.log(report.overall, report.grade);
console.log(renderTerminal(report));
const claudeMd = generateSkill(report, "claude");
```

---

## Architecture (it eats its own dog food)

```
src/
  core/         orchestrator, types, scoring engine, scanner, constants
  detect/       language / framework / project-type detection
  analyzers/    universal-tier checks — one module per category (Analyzer interface)
  adapters/     deep-tier language plugins: js-ts, python, go (LangAdapter interface)
  advisor/      folder-structure classification + recommendation
  reporters/    terminal | json | html
  generators/   SYSTEM_DESIGN.md + AI skill files
  ai/           optional --deep-ai (user's own key or local Ollama)
  cli/          argument parsing + run loop
  bin/          archscore executable
```

Analyzers and adapters are pluggable behind common interfaces, so **new language
analyzers and new checks drop in without touching the core**.

### Adding a language adapter

Implement `LangAdapter` (build an adjacency map of module → imports, hand it to
`analyzeGraph`), then register it in `src/adapters/index.ts`. That's it — the
Deep tier picks it up for matching projects automatically.
